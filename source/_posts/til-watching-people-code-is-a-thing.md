So lately, thanks to Twitch, there's been a new phenomenon on the interwebs to do with watching people play games. This craze got so big that large companies such as Google and Amazon [are willing to spend millions to buy Twitch](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/amazon-buys-twitch-for-970m-beating-google-to-tap-a-new-global-phenomenon-of-gamers-9691039.html) because of how successful it is.

Well, it looks like watching people _write code live_ is now becoming a thing. There's a growing reddit community ([/r/WatchPeopleCode](http://www.reddit.com/r/WatchPeopleCode)) dedicated to it, and a website was made to list the current live streams from reddit: [watchpeoplecode.com](http://www.watchpeoplecode.com/). The purpose is simple. You watch someone write code live online. Sometimes it's someone giving a tutorial and speaking to the audience. Sometimes it is just someone working on their own project - maybe there's better productivity when you know someone's watching you code.

Who knows I might try it out one day. Or maybe in the future 'watch people blog' will become a thing. Who knows?
