Some say you can't be productive in Ramadan. I disagree. You can be _more_<sup>*</sup> productive while fasting, and it can help you stay focused. Here's how I do it.

<small><sup>*</sup>Coding while fasting made me a really _fast_ coder. Ok that was terrible.</small>

## 1\. Ease off the coffee

> pro·gram·mer (n) An organism capable of converting caffeine into code.

As true as the definition above may seem, you can still be a programmer without drinking coffee. I promise. Coffee can help you concentrate, but a lot of the time it's our [perception of this than its true effects](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/02/decaf-coffee-buzz-caffeine_n_946746.html?ir=Food). So, to increase focus during Ramadan, I decided to slowly reduce my caffeine intake as Ramadan got closer. This means I'm less dependent on coffee to stay [awake](http://media.giphy.com/media/emWySpOLFLUAM/giphy.gif) (e.g. on Monday mornings), and I can reduce the [withdrawal symptoms](http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-withdrawal-symptoms-top-ten) during the month.

## 2\. Fast Mondays and Thursdays

Intermittent fasting has [health benefits](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19112549) and immense [reward](http://sunnah.com/muslim/13/213). On the run up to Ramadan this gives you the extra benefit of getting your body prepared for the long fasts. Once the month starts, you're already used to it and are able to spend your energy on other ibadaat.

## 3\. Go out for no lunch

Instead of sitting at your desk for very long periods, go out. Even better, go for a walk to the local Masjid, pray Duhr, and stay there for a while. You might not be feeding your body but you're nourishing your soul ;)

## 4\. Stop thinking about food and think about the ajr

[![Do as you're told!](http://meltuhamy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/thinking-food.jpg)](http://meltuhamy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/thinking-food.jpg)

I know it's hard, especially when you get those emails from people coming back from holidays with different types of sweets from all over the world. So instead, every time you think about food, think about the reward you'll get inshaAllah.

> Whoever observes fasts during the month of Ramadan out of sincere faith, and **hoping to attain Allah's rewards**, then all his past sins will be forgiven. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)

## 5\. Stop blaming it on the fasting

You always hear people doing silly mistakes and saying "sorry, I'm fasting today". This will only make you believe that fasting will decrease your performance. Take a positive outlook on the fasting. If you keep telling yourself it's affecting you negatively, it will. If you tell yourself it _improves_ your productivity, which imho it does, it will.
